## 2. Personalized Tasks:
- If you are familiar with or interested in some apps or websites, such as music apps, HKU portal, Twitter, Intagram, Reddits, photoshop tools, video editing tools, gaming platform, ..., you can think of tasks that you usually do on these apps and websites. You can annotate tasks one by one or use the app for 15 minutes or longer and then segment them into individual tasks.
