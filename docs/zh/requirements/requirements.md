**Annotation Guidelines**:

!!! Warning "Stability Control"

    We recommend that you **do not exceed 15 minutes for a single recording session with AgentNet** to control the stability of the recording. Longer videos carry a higher risk of loss or processing errors. We hope that each of your recordings can be saved intact!

What tasks should we annotate?

!!! Success "Daily Life Tasks"
    
    Focus on commonly used apps or websites, such as email, Google Docs, Excel, Zoom, etc. The everyday tasks people often perform on their PCs.

!!! Success "Personalized Tasks"

    If you are familiar with or interested in some apps or websites, such as music apps, HKU portal, Twitter, Intagram, Reddits, photoshop tools, video editing tools, gaming platform, ..., you can think of tasks that you usually do on these apps and websites. You can annotate tasks one by one or use the app for 15 minutes or longer and then segment them into individual tasks.

!!! Success "Tasks with Professional Knowledge"

    If you have experience with professional tools like VMware, AWS, Google Cloud, pgAdmin, etc., or workflows that are typical in your work, feel free to annotate these.

!!! Success "Task Tutorial List"

    We have provided a task tutorial list: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HvgAYIvv_UgpPfOQgv473J4SlCPIl9qp8ev32FA7Muc/edit?gid=2116871868#gid=2116871868). There are three task categories: Web, OS, and Apps. You can browse the task descriptions and pick the task that you are familiar with or interested in, put your email in the "Annotator" column, and annotate the task following the "instrutions". Note: For the first few weeks, we encourage you to come up with tasks on your own, rather than relying on the provided list.

**Requirements:**

1. The **task name**, **description** and **actions** should be generally correct and detailed.
2. The **tasks should be diverse** (from different domains)
3. The **task should not be too easy** (A single type/click, or a very easy 2/3-step task) **or meaningless** (Wonâ€™t be used again by other people).

**Verification Guidelines**:

Automatic Assignment: Verifiers will be automatically assigned tasks until no unverified tasks remain.

**Rejection Criteria:**

!!! Failure "Rejection Criteria"

    1. Reject a task if it is a test task or is too simple (fewer than 3 steps and lacks meaningful content).

    2. Reject if there are significant errors in the task trajectory (e.g., missing crucial steps, tasks that can't be replayed using existing actions).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

!!! Tip "Acceptance Criteria"
   
    Accept a task if it is entirely correct or has only minor mistakes in the description or actions. In the future, we will offer more grading options such as Very Good, Accept, Request Edits, and Reject.

**Important Notes**:

1. **Browser Setup:** Ensure your browser is set up to save HTML files. 
2. **Feedback:** Please report any bugs or suggest possible improvements while using the app.
3. **Time Efficiency:** Share feedback on which parts of the annotation pipeline are most time-consuming and suggest ways to improve speed.
