# Bad Annotation Examples

## 1 Task is too simple
### a. Tasks that has only 2~3 actions.

!!! Question "How To Improve"

    Think of a longer workflow that contain this simple task. For example, Take a screenshot of pgAdmin, save it to the folder "Desktop/database activities", record the number in the Google Doc.

## 2 Task name and description is incorrect/too simple

### a. Untitled task name and description

### b. Very simple description that can not describe the step-by-step plan of the task

## 3 Unpolished/wrong actions

??? Failure "Unpolished Actions"

    The actions are not polished, remaining the same as the raw actions.

??? Failure "Too Many Redundant Actions"

    Too many redundant actions: Many meaningless actions or actions that is not related to the task goal, such as clicking the space, irrelevant scrolls...

??? Failure "Actions and Video Clips don't Match"

    Some action doesn't match the videe clip: For example, it should be click the AgentNet V0 Documentation page, but the annotated action is Click ChatGPT

## 4 Lack of Diversity
- Annotate too many tasks with the same kind: For example:
    - Draw a tree; draw a people; draw...
    - Find the most popular song of XX; find the second popular song of XX; Find the most popular album of XX
    - Create a Dynamodb called XXX; Create a Dynamodb called YYY;  Create a Dynamodb called ZZZ at region N;
- Annotate too many daily-life tasks: You can annotate some tasks from daily-life apps, such as GMail, Google Doc, but you should try to switch to use different apps and do different tasks. Also, try to use some less commonly used apps
