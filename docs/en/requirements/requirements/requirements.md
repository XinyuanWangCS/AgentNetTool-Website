# Annotation Requirements
<!-- 1. The **task description** and **actions** should be generally correct, and there shouldn't be irrelevant actions.
2. The **tasks should be diverse** (from different domains)
3. The **task should not be too easy** (A single type/click, or a very easy 2/3-step task) **or meaningless** (Wonâ€™t be used again by other people). -->
## Evaluation & Payment Criteria

!!! Warning
    <span style="color:red;">**Important Notice**</span>: Please read the following part carefully. Your payment will be decided by the following criteria.



## **Acceptance Criteria:**

For an accepted tasks, we have three levels of quality: <span style="color:red;"> **OK** (partial payment), **Good**(full payment), **Excellent** (with bonus e.g. 2x full payment).</span>

We have two dimensions to evaluate the tasks: **Complexity** and **Creativity**

### **1. Complexity**: How complex your task and actions are. 
A task will be considered more complex, if it:

- **Has many actions**

    <img src="../assets/req1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

- **Requires complex operations**: Performing intricate tasks that demand advanced features or settings within a specific application.

- **Involves professional apps/skills**: E.g. VSCode, Snowflake, BigQuery, dbt, AutoCAD, Tableau, AWS S3, VMWare, Adobe PhotoShop, etc.

**Note:** Common daily life tasks (e.g. emails, zoom, Google Docs, Excel, etc.) can also be considered as good/excellent examples if they are creative/complex and involve multiple apps.


**Note: <u>The complexity of a task is not strictly decided by action number. If a task satisfies other metrics, it will still be considered as complex. While duplicates of simple and the same task can lower the complexity. </u>**

### **2. Creativity**
- **Diversity of tasks and domains**: Your tasks should cover various domains and types, avoiding repetitively doing similar tasks such as installing many apps, creating accounts on various websites, or simply copying tasks with minor changes. <span style="color:red;">Warning</span>: Your account may be banned if this happens.
- **Involves multiple apps/websites**: Complete the task requires interacting among multiple websites and apps.


**Tips:** You can find and refer to app/website tutorial videos on YouTube to come up with creative and complex tasks.
